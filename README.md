# The-Plain-Escape
A hard platformer game where you have a shield made in Godot.

It's too dangerous to live in the plains now, your father saw this coming, so he intrusts you with a shield more powerful then any other to defend you from harm while leaving the plains.


This game was made for the NES jam.
